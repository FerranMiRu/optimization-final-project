# Optimization Final Project

The original repository can be found at [https://github.com/amidos2006/Mario-AI-Framework](https://github.com/amidos2006/Mario-AI-Framework)

## Project Description

- Each team must choose a research paper (which can be multidisciplinary, related to their previous
  background, and/or related to their field of interest). If you have problems finding the paper,
  please, contact any of the professors explaining your interests.
- Submit a small report with the following information (deadline December 14th):
  - Title and reference of the paper.
  - Small abstract about the interest of the paper and its relation to Optimization.
  - Distribution of the duties of the project among the members of the team.
- Submit the project at latest two days before the exposition. The project must contain:
  - Motivation.
  - Introduction to the optimization problem.
  - Explanation of the used algorithms.
  - If it applies, proposal of other algorithms to solve the same optimization problem (and comparation).
  - If it applies, reproduce part of the methodology or computations (can be in a simplified example).
- Evaluation: in both (written project and oral exposition) we will evaluate the structure, comprehensivity and consistency. The discussion about the reliability of the used model will be taken into consideration.
